# wolkenkit-template-chat

wolkenkit-template-chat is an application template for wolkenkit.

## Installation

This is an application template for [wolkenkit](https://www.wolkenkit.io), a CQRS- and event-sourcing framework for JavaScript and Node.js. If you have not yet installed its CLI, please see the [thenativeweb/wolkenkit](https://github.com/thenativeweb/wolkenkit) repository.

To install this template use the wolkenkit CLI:

```shell
$ wolkenkit init --template https://github.com/thenativeweb/wolkenkit-template-chat.git
```

## Quick start

Since this template contains a complete application, you can run it without further ado. To start the server, run the following command:

```shell
$ wolkenkit start
```

To start the client, you first have to set it up. Therefore, run the following commands to switch to the `client` directory and install the client's dependencies:

```shell
$ cd client
$ npm install
```

Then to actually run the client use the following command from inside the `client` directory:

```shell
$ npm run serve
```
